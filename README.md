To send over any submitted form data to Netlify, Netlify Forms needs to recognize a form as static HTML. Because our React app is controlled by JavaScript and doesn't consist of plain HTML, we need to add a hidden form to our index.html file in the public folder.

As you can see above, we are encoding the form data with a special encode function that you see here.


How does this stick to top of the page on a larger device? With the help of the class md:sticky on our header element.

This class means that it will have the style rule position: sticky;
